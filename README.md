# TIPI

(Pronounced tip-ee)

Turn a Raspberry PI and some glue hardware into a TI Disk Drive and Network interface. 

Keep it open for further device extension.

## Branching

- End users must be on the `release` branch for physical TIPI
- or for emulation, the `emuRelease` branch
- `master` branch is full of stuff that doesn't work, won't upgrade correctly, and certainly won't downgrade
- `master` branch is expert mode only
