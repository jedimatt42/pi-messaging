# Hardare design files for TIPI board and ROM driver software

This package below contains the hardware design files. These are un-encumbered open license files you can all do whatever you want with...

* tipi-peb - contains the PCB designs for the Periphal Expansion Box variant of the board. 
  * gerbers - artifacts for PCB fabrication
  * kicad - pcb schematic and layout design files for KiCad
  * ise - the verilog - Xilinx ISE 14.1 project files (use this with tipi-sideport design also)
* tipi-sideport - contains the PCB designs for the sideport board
  * gerbers - artifacts for PCB fabrication
  * kicad - pcb schematic and layout design files for KiCad
* tipi-speech - contains the PCB designs for the Speech Synthsizer Box variant of the TIPI board. 
  * gerbers - artifacts for PCB fabrication
  * kicad - pcb schematic and layout design files for KiCad
  * ise - the verilog - Xilinx ISE 14.1 project files (combined 32k and TIPI decoding)
* dsr - the ROM driver software for messaging to the PI and general DISK like behavior.
